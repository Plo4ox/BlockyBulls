Because they did not partake in any of these activities. Nobody cared about any of this... They just want to live among us, to walk the same streets as us, to talk about the same things as us, to fall in love with the same person as us. They need validation and acceptance just like the rest of us. But they are not the type to be validated or accepted. They are easy to differentiate from the rest of us, but they think otherwise. They are masters of shapeshifting, but you could still recoginize them no matter what shape they are in. They could be turned into weapons in the wrong hands, but to this date, no wrong hand wanted to turn them into weapons.",

    "description": "Avastars (est. in Feb. 2020) are generative characters for the metaverse. Each one is unique and has their art and metadata stored on-chain. Avastars come licensed for use commercially by their owners. Collect Avastar Primes to make Replicants with their trait copies. IMPORTANT: When someone uses/burns a trait copy from an Avastar Prime, OpenSea shows \u201c-Burned\u201d after the trait name. ALWAYS CLICK ON A TRAIT TO SEE IF IT\u2019S COPY IS BURNED BEFORE PURCHASE IF THIS IS IMPORTANT TO YOU. There is also a \u201cMINT CONDITION\u201d trait. All Avastars #0-25,199 are Avastar Primes. #25,200+ are Avastar Replicants. You cannot make a Replicant with another Replicant\u2019s traits, and no 2 Avastar Primes or Replicants can ever be the same. You can also see whether an Avastar is a Prime or a Replicant under the \u201cWave\u201d category. For more info, visit the Avastars Discord.",

    "description": "969 pixel baddies created by WizardX on August 12th 2023. BPG is a collection of art that exists without purpose. No value is implied. There is no community besides that which you may create yourselves. There is no utility. There is no social media. There is no hype. There is no pump. There is only art.\n\nBPG is an ongoing experimental art project by WizardX. Metadata is not final. Collection size will NOT increase. The Pixel Gods however, continue to exert their divine will on the traits that exist. Traits cannot be removed, but they can be added in a manner that furthers the artistic quality of the collection until one day when it will be declared final.\n\nExpect rarity scores to change as traits are added.\n\n-->sister collection (DPG) here: https://opensea.io/collection/dankpixelgods",

Crafted by the illustrious Octopus Nation, the driving force behind Octopus Network, these NFTs transcend the realm of mere digital art.
